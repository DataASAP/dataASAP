# Contributing to Atom

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

There is a lot of work that I'd like to do to this application to make it more useful.

DataASAP was developed using the following technologies:
* Electron
* React-Redux-Router
* Semantic UI React
* Javascript
* Electron Builder

#### Current State
The current state is that it supports most current NCPDP transactions (Telecom D.0, SCRIPT 10.6 and the newer SCRIPT 20170714), though I can't guarantee all. Ideally, I'd like to include X12 and HL7 transactions. 

I've tried to keep the interface clean and simple, the interface goal is for someone to install the software and start using it by just looking at it. 

The [Issues section](https://github.com/dcheli/dataASAP/issues) contains items I am aware of that need work. Some items are very broad and can/will be broken down into smaller items in time. 

#### Developers
If you are a developer,  are interested in the tech stack I am using and want to contribute, please contact me. I know that there are many opportunities for refactoring, some identified in the issues section and others that I may not be aware of. 

As mentioned above, I'd like to add X12 and HL7, but am open to other transaction sets as well.

#### Testers
If you are a tester, I can use some help. Does this run on your platform? Are there transactions that aren't supported well? Do the features work? Do you have sample data that you can add to the test folder? Is there a good way to automate testing this? 

#### Suggestors
I am open to suggestions and will prioritize suggestions based on my time, interest from others, and time that possibly some other developers and testers would want to work on them.
